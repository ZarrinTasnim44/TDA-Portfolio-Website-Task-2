# Styled Portfolio Website (Task 2)

This project is a **Styled Personal Portfolio Website**, created as a continuation of the basic HTML portfolio (Task 1).  
In this task, CSS is used to enhance the visual appearance, layout, and responsiveness of the existing portfolio without changing its core structure.

## Project Overview and Objectives

The main objective of this project is to apply **CSS styling concepts** to an already created HTML portfolio and make it visually appealing and responsive.

The goals of this task are:
- To use an **external CSS file** for styling
- To apply different **CSS selectors**
- To add **hover effects** for better user interaction
- To design a **responsive layout** for mobile screens
- To use **CSS Grid and Flexbox** for layout structuring
- To apply a consistent **color scheme and font styling**

## Code Structure Explanation

### index.html
- Contains the main structure of the portfolio website
- Uses semantic HTML elements such as `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, and `footer`
- Links the external stylesheet using the `<link>` tag
- Includes sections for About, Skills, Projects, and Contact
- Displays the profile image using a relative path from the `images` folder

### style.css
- Contains all CSS styling rules
- Uses element selectors, class selectors, and pseudo-class selectors
- Applies colors, spacing, borders, and shadows for better design
- Uses Flexbox for navigation layout
- Uses CSS Grid for skills and projects layout
- Includes media queries for responsive design

### script.js
- Adds basic interactivity to the contact form
- Prevents form submission and shows a demonstration alert

## CSS Concepts Used

The following CSS concepts are used in this project:
- External CSS file
- Element selectors (e.g., body, header, section)
- Class selectors (e.g., `.container`, `.profile-pic`, `.skills-list`)
- Pseudo-class selectors (e.g., `:hover`)
- Box model (margin, padding, border, box-sizing)
- Flexbox for layout alignment
- CSS Grid for content layout
- Media queries for responsive design
- Consistent color scheme and system-based custom font stack

---

## How the Technical Requirements Are Met

- **External CSS file created:**  
  All styling is written in `style.css` and linked to the HTML file.

- **At least three CSS selectors used:**  
  Element, class, and pseudo-class selectors are used throughout the stylesheet.

- **Hover effects implemented:**  
  Hover effects are applied to navigation links and interactive elements.

- **Responsive design implemented:**  
  Media queries ensure the website adapts properly to smaller screen sizes.

- **CSS Grid and Flexbox used:**  
  Flexbox is used for navigation layout, and CSS Grid is used for skills and project sections.

- **Custom color scheme and fonts added:**  
  A consistent color palette is applied across the website, along with a system-based custom font stack for better readability and cross-platform compatibility.

- Desktop view of the portfolio
- About section with profile image
- Skills and Projects sections
- Contact form with hover effects
- Mobile responsive view

## Conclusion

This task successfully enhances the basic portfolio website using CSS.  
The styled portfolio meets all technical requirements, is responsive, visually appealing, and demonstrates the practical use of CSS concepts without altering the original HTML structure.
